                <p class="margin-top-10">AI, ML, and DS are three interrelated fields in computer science and
                    statistics. AI focuses on creating intelligent systems, ML enables computers to learn from data and
                    make predictions, and DS leverages data to extract insights and drive decision-making. These three
                    fields often overlap and complement each other in solving real-world problems and advancing
                    technology.

                    Let’s understand each one by one.
                    <br>

                    Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI involves the development of an intelligent system that can perform
                    the tasks that typically require human cognitive functions like learning, reasoning,
                    problem-solving, building perception, and decision-making.
                    Machine Learning (ML): ML is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the
                    development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems or machines to perform
                    tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so.
                    Data Science (DS): Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines various techniques and
                    methods from statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to extract
                    insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data.
